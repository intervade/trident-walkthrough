# What is this?
Although I've made a general FFF/FDM 3D printing guide, there's a lot of information there. This guide is specifically intended to get those working under Dr. Abegaz and Dr. Chen started. Since I've built identical Voron Tridents for each of them, this is detailing what is needed for *these printers*.

## However
This still might be useful to others, if anyone stumbles on it.
