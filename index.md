# What is this?
Although I've made a [general FFF/FDM 3D printing guide], there's a lot of information there. Some is applicable for us and some not. After reading the general guide, this one is intended to talk about which of the topics covered there apply to our machines. Therefore, this guide is specifically intended to get those working under Dr. Abegaz and Dr. Chen aquainted with the nuances of our particular setup. Since I've built identical Voron Tridents for each of them, this is detailing what is needed for [*these printers*].

## What about the one that isn't a trident?
That's Dr. Chen's Voxelab Aquila X2. It'll have [it's own tab], although shorter, since it's a much more simple machine. Hopefully it's also just a backup machine.

## However
This still might be useful to others, if anyone stumbles on it.
