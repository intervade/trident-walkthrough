# Everything needs a stable base!
Before any of the cool stuff actually happens, there needs to be something that all the other parts can attach to. In our case, our frame is made of different lengths of black anodized 2020 aluminum extrusions
held together with blind joints. The ends of the extrusions are tapped with an M5 thread for these joints. The extrusions must be square with each other to create dimensionally accurate prints. As such, it would
not be a great idea to mess with the frame, unless you are sure you need to do so. [The manual] details in what order and how to put the extrusions togther.

## What's a blind joint?
[In our case, it's a way of holding together aluminum extrusions so that no outside brackets are needed.] Just the extrusions and the M5 bolts make up the whole frame.

## [Okay, the frame's done. Motion?]
