# [The Voron Trident]
This printer is sweet.

## Who/What is Voron Design?
Voron Design is not a company. It's a group of engineers and other smart people that have taken a special interest in coming together to design enthusiast grade FFF printers. As such, they cannot provide support nor does their website have any shop.

## If it's not a company, what did we buy?
Since each design is open source and has a bill of materials, certain vendors and manufacturers from China have decided to provide full kits to build Voron printers. Before this, everything was self sourced, which could be difficult. We bought a 300x300x250mm Formbot Trident kit from 3D Printers Bay. Formbot is the Chinese manufacturer that makes the kit. 3D Printers Bay is a company that stocks and ships printers from the United States.

## Why the Trident design?
Of these enthusiast designs, I think this is the most approachable, well rounded one. It has a fast CoreXY motion system, automatic bed leveling, and an enclosed chamber. It's also made with modularity in mind to future-proof it.

## Not everything is stock
I've built the machines with two changes: the part cooling and the Z probe. These differences will be covered more when their sections come up.

## Other than this, where can I find support?
Since these are somewhat popular machines to build now, you can find support on popular platforms such as reddit or discord. Additionally, consult [the manual].
